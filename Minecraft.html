							<p >Minecraft is a sandbox video game that uses blocks to represent the world and its components; you can think of it a lot like virtual Legos. It was created in 2009 by the programmer Notch from the Mojang company. Since then, it has sold over 200 million copies and by 2020 has over 126 million monthly active users.Players can explore the world and build or destroy because every block is breakable. Buildings and other structures are made by placing blocks on top of or next to each other. From these materials, you can create wondrous structures and functional machinery.</p>

	<h3>What is Minecraft?</h3>
	<p>Minecraft is a video game in which players create and break apart various kinds of blocks in three-dimensional worlds. The gameâ€™s two main modes are Survival and Creative. In Survival, players must find their own building supplies and food. They also interact with blocklike mobs, or moving creatures. (Creepers and zombies are some of the dangerous ones.) In Creative, players are given supplies and do not have to eat to survive. They also can break all kinds of blocks immediately.</p>
